# ncvis
 NetCDF Visualizer

Developed by Paul A. Ullrich

Funding for the development of ncvis is provided by the United States Department of Energy Office of Science under the Regional and Global Model Analysis project "SEATS: Simplifying ESM Analysis Through Standards."

ncvis is inspired by David Pierce's most excellent ncview utility (http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html)
